Adding a button.

1. Go to the home page, or wherever the HTML will go, and add the html, or as much as you can.
You will need to add a container and the html.

2. Create the container. The container tells the HTML how to render the button. Be sure to import it into Home.
Use the container in the html.

3. In the HTML, you also have to call a function that fires an ACTION. So, create the action.
